2 Player Game
 - Left / Right
   - Inputs
   - Score
 - Serve starts in a random direction, 
within the bouds of aiming at any corner, 
but no farther towards the middel
 - Serve speed is at half, once ball is hit
by paddel speed sets to normal
 - Paddels move slower than ball at normal
speed. Somewhere from 80%-90%

Does the ball bounce off the paddels?
Based off of observation, the ball doesnt bounce
normaly. I belevie that depending on where the 
ball comes into contact with the paddel, a certain
velocity vecotr gets added to the balls velocity. The
highter on the paddel you hit the ball, the more 
upwards the velocity added will be. The lower
on paddel you hit the ball, the lower the balls 
trajectory is set to. My plan is to linearly scale
the added vectors direction going from traveling
perpindicular to the paddel in the middle, all the 
way to 45 degrees hitting on the edges"
